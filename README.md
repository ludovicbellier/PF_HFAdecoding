# PF_HFAdecoding
- This repository contains all the MATLAB and Python code produced and used in our paper "Encoding and decoding analysis of music perception using intracranial EEG" ([see latest version on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.27.478085v2)).
- PF_MASTERSCRIPT.m lists all the steps performed (preprocessing, encoding analyses, and decoding analyses).
- PF_NeMo_MASTERSCRIPT.py is the Python MASTERSCRIPT used for modeling purpose, based on the [Neural Modeling toolbox](https://github.com/ludovicbellier/NeMo).
- example parameter files are included to show how to use PF_NeMo_MASTERSCRIPT.py for encoding models (params8.txt) and nonlinear decoding models (params96.txt)
